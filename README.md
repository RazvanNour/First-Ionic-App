
Movie local Database

The application will search for the closest cinema, and provide the user with info about the movies that are running through the current time. 
In the first activity/fragment, it will have a list of all cinemas close to the user, displayed using recycle view for each item.
Here there will be the feature for adding/removing an item (Crud operations).
Once clicking on an item, you will be redirected to an activity/fragment where it will be the details about the cinema, together with a slide show of all the movies running for that week.
On this page I can also integrate the google maps feature to show the usere where is the cinema located.
Maybe there will be a feature to buy tickets for a designated movie (here i can use an email feature to confirm purchase) and also there will be a section for editing all the credentials for your account plus user picture, so I can use local storage permission or camera permission to take photos.
Another local service would be ofcourse the location for the Google Maps integration.
The animations will be used maybe for the crossover navigation through the pages, or to the crud operation (i will decide later).
